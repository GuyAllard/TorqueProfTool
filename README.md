# TorqueProfTool
TorqueProfTool can be used to convert the profiler output from the Torque3D engine into a json format call graph which can be visualized using tools such as gprof2dot and graphviz.

## Example
This call-graph was generated from the profiler dump of the [Pacific demo scene](http://torque3d.wdfiles.com/local--files/communityproject%3Aperformance%3Aprofiling-and-optimisation/profilerDumpToFile241587.txt) from [Torque3D.org](http://torque3d.org)
